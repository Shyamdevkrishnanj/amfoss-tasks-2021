# JSExplorer
I was really influenced by this JSExplorer task. Although the task was to debug errors, I was so interested in it. The first aand third page was easy, and found second page a bit hard. By doing the second page, I was introduced to a new language-JavaScript. It was fun finding the errors and fixing it. I googled many of the function of JS. Reffered many YouTube videos to get it done.

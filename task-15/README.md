# Project Euler
For me,it was all about reading. I tried to impliment the code using the mathematical approach and failed. Then I read the Discussion part given in the Hackerrank site itself. I have done 4/5 in this task.I have used Python for solving the questions. I have not done it by myself, but yeah I have learned something.

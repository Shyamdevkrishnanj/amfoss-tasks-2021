# Introspection
### Why must we choose you?
   I was a Biomath student but has great turn towards computers and tech. Since I'm a student with a passion towards learning more about programming from zero,
   I find amFoss as the perfect club for me. I hope amfoss will guide me to learn more about programming and to continue my passion towards it. 


### What is your plan for the next 6 months?

### How would you contribute back to the club?

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

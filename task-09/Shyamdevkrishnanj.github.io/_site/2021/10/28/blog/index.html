    <p>The AmFOSS Tasks were so good that i learned many things from it. I’ve seen AmFOSS club activites before I joined Amrita University. That’s the main reason why I chose Amritapuri campus. This year the tasks were easier for a noobie like me compared to the previous tasks that I’ve seen earlier. I started with task 11,’Poster Designing’, which felt easier for me as I’ve designed many posters:) Then I started sequentially from task-0 and got stuck at the prograaming task since I’ve no prior experience in programming. I stick with that task for almost a week and moved on to other tasks.</p>

<p>I progressed through each task, and learned to use terminal commands , build a webpage and design it which kept me more interested to do more and more tasks. The tasks are so well structured that people with no experience (like me) could do many things. I’ve come a long way in such a short time that Now I believe I could do more.</p>

<p>Thanks to AmFOSS Tasks, that now I know what to learn and what to focus more.</p>

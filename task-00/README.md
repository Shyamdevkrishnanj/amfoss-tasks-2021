# Installation of UBUNTU 20.04(Desktop)
This task was easy but had me more time into it.I bought a new laptop and this was the first thing i did.The installation part was easy for me. I dual booted it and now I'm using ubuntu everytime.But there were issues after the installation.My WiFi drivers were not working.I spent a lot more time to get it resolved.Anyways it was fun and I learned a lot about cmd commands.....
First I downloaded Ubuntu from the site. Then installed Rufus installer. I have partioned my SSD to create a free space. Then I reboot my lap with a USB plugged in. Hence I installed Ubuntu in the free space and allocated my partioned space.

I love to change themes to give new look to the whole OS and its pretty easy in ubuntu, so I have changed the theme also .

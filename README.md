# My Views About The Tasks
 
### I have fully completed  11 tasks of 16 and partially completed 2 tasks. The tasks were really interesting. There were many challenges both hard and easy. I learnt many things day by day doing the tasks. I am so satisfied with the task that I have really extended my knowledge after doing the tasks. 

# My Intro

### Hi guys ðŸ˜‡. Let me introduce myself to you. I'm Shyamdev Krishnan J from Trivandrum, Kerala. I came to know about amFOSS club when I was searching the details of Amrita university. I came to know more about the club through Quora. So decided to join the Amritapuri campus. So the main thing that attracts me about the club is its mentoring attributes. I chose Science as main subject in 12th grade, but always had interest in programming. But I wasn't able to finish the languages.I know the basics of Python, C++ and java(not much). After attempting the tasks, I have improved in many sectors. I want to continue this flow of improvement so that one day I could really fulfill my passion. I hope the amFOSS club will help me to achieve my passion.
